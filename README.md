GitStat: A Github data mining app
		                
This web app collects users, repositories and issues data
 using Github V3 API in realtime and plots the relevant information in graphs using Plot.ly.
                                
*NOTE:* If some of the graphs are not showing any data, that might be
because the Github API is having downtime. Please try again some time
later for results.
